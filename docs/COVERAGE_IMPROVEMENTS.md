# Test Coverage Improvements

This document outlines the test coverage improvements made in the `feature/improve-test-coverage` branch.

## Summary of Improvements

We have successfully improved the test coverage of the codebase from 27.85% to 29.57%, focusing on key areas:

1. **Main Module**: Improved coverage from 40.78% to 46.93%
   - Added tests for CLI commands (setup, list-models, etc.)
   - Ensured interactive session functionality can be properly tested without hanging

2. **Base Tool Module**: Dramatically improved coverage from 25.00% to 87.50%
   - Added comprehensive tests for the BaseTool class
   - Tested function declaration generation for various parameter types
   - Added error handling tests

3. **Models**:
   - Maintained 100% coverage for AbstractModelAgent base class
   - Added tests for OllamaModel class (41.03% coverage)

## Files Added

- `tests/test_main.py`: Tests for the CLI interface and command handlers
- `tests/tools/test_base_tool.py`: Tests for the BaseTool class

## Next Steps for Further Coverage Improvement

To continue improving test coverage, the following areas should be addressed:

1. **Gemini Model**: Currently at 8.15% coverage, this is the module with the lowest coverage.
   - Create additional tests for the GeminiModel class
   - Focus on `generate` method which contains most of the logic

2. **Tool Implementations**: Several tools have low coverage:
   - `file_tools.py`: 13.56% coverage
   - `tree_tool.py`: 16.48% coverage
   - `summarizer_tool.py`: 18.92% coverage
   - `test_runner.py`: 18.75% coverage
   - `directory_tools.py`: 21.74% coverage

3. **Config Module**: Currently at 41.21% coverage
   - Add tests for configuration management
   - Test various edge cases in configuration handling

## Testing Challenges

1. **Interactive Testing**: Tests that involve user interaction need careful mocking to avoid hanging.

2. **External API Calls**: Models that make external API calls require proper mocking.

3. **Function Declarations**: The FunctionDeclaration object structure can be challenging to test due to variations in implementation.

## Conclusion

The improvements demonstrate significant progress in key areas of the codebase. By focusing on these critical modules first, we've established a solid foundation for further testing. Continuing to improve test coverage will enhance code reliability and facilitate future development.
