# Workflow trigger optimization:
# - PR events: Run full validation tests to verify code quality before merging
# - Push to main: Run build and tests after merge to ensure main branch stability
# - Tag events: Trigger releases to PyPI
#
# This separation reduces redundant CI runs by not triggering on feature branch pushes
# since those will be validated through PR checks when ready to merge
